# Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition TypeScript Solutions

ğŸš§ I am currently preparing for coding interview and this repository is a WIP. This repository may be missing some questions or even some chapters. The solutions to questions might not be the most efficient. You can run tests suite to check if the solutions work as expected.

Thanks to [CtCI-6th-Edition-JavaScript-ES2015](https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-JavaScript-ES2015) for the tests.

### Install dependecies to be able to run the tests suite

> I have used [jest](https://jestjs.io) for creating the tests suite.

```bash
yarn
```

### Run the tests suite

```bash
yarn test
```
